LocusMacrorelationsRelation:
  Description : >
     Type of syntactic relation about which the locus is specified. The categories are derived from choosing

     if there are several entries, we pick the one marked as the default for locus of marking

       [Single argument of intransitive verb], [Single argument in intransitives that are derived from
       transitives through (anti)passives and other detransitivizing morpholexical operations (only if
       the language makes a distinction between derived and non-derived S)], [Experiencers that mostly

       in the same way as agents. If they are coded like patients, they are treated as ‘A-exp’ here.],
       [Experiencers that behave like A but not entirely. Since this is a form class concept, it includes
       arguments that are ‘obliged’ in an obligation construction and possessors in dative possessor
       constructions (subspecies of A-obl). An experiencer is an A-exp only if it is thematically/topically
       more prominent than the stimulus; otherwise it is a plain Patient.], [Transitive actors that are
       animate], [volitional, agentive actors irrespective of transitivity. Typical in active/stative
       systems, but often grammaticalized to a degree where ‘agentivity’ or ‘control’ do no longer predict
       the distribution of the role.], [Pronominal A’s, including demonstratives. If the distinction
       is between personal pronouns and everything else it is more likely to have to with empathy (‘A-emp’)],

       covering ALL experiencers as distinct from A’s. If only some experiencers are covered, the others
       being coded like agentive A’s, then this is coded as ‘A-exp’]
    'P' : >
       [Most patientive argument of monotransitive verb. Includes ‘contents/stimuli’ as long as they
       are coded in the same way as patients. If they are coded like agents, they are treated as ‘C’
       here], [Patientive argument irrespective of transitivity. Typical in active/stative systems, but
       often grammaticalized to a degree where ‘agentivity’ or ‘control’ do no longer predict the distribution
       of the role.], [Theme argument of ditransitives; corresponds to ‘secondary object’ in a language
       that conflates U and G.], [beneficiary, goal, recipient argument of ditransitives; corresponds
       to ‘indirect object’ in a language that conflates U and T.], [Definite U. Good example: accusative
       marked Turkish direct objects], [Definite T. Good example: accusative marked Turkish direct objects],
       [U with high empathy/animacy. Good example: Spanish a, Indo-Iranian datives], [Goal of motion
       verbs], [stimuli that mostly but not entirely behave like the most patientive argument of transitive
       verbs], [comitative object of applicative], [locative object of applicative], [circumstantial
       object of applicative], [instrumental object of applicative], [U in the nominative, unmarked case],
       [T in the nominative, unmarked case], [Recipients of ditransitives if formally distinct from beneficiaries
       and goals], [Recipients of ditransitives if formally distinct from recipients and goals], [Referential
       object,i.e. all arguments except those that refer to generic kinds], [Incorporated pronoun (can’t
       co-occur with co-referential overt object NP in the same clause).], [Nonspecific U], [U in the
       presence of an unmarked A; if the A is case-marked, U is not also case-marked. Example: Rapanui
       Accusative], [U with both specific and animate reference], [U with specific reference], [B with
       specific reference], [B with definite reference], [U with human reference], [B in a possessor-denoting
       case (genitive)]
    'POSS' : >
       [Possessor: all genitival relations in an NP. Note: if a POSS marker is sused for indicating experience
       beyond literal possession (e.g. my-thirst/my-love is.there vs. literal my-leg/my-heart hurts)
       note this as A-exp (if with bivalent predicate) or as S-exp (if with a monovalent predicate)],
       [possessor with specific reference]
    'ATTR' : >
       The relation borne by attributive adjectives.
